## Cyber Security Reflection

### What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the state or process of protecting and recovering computer systems, networks, devices, and programs from any type of cyber attack. Cyber attacks are an increasingly sophisticated and evolving danger to your sensitive data, as attackers employ new methods powered by social engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) to circumvent traditional data security controls.

The fact of the matter is the world is increasingly reliant on technology and this reliance will continue as we introduce the next generation of new technology that will have access to our connected devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

To keep customer data protected while embracing new technology, intelligent cloud security solutions should be implemented alongside strong password policies like multi-factor authentication to mitigate unauthorized access.

### The Importance of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity's importance is on the rise. Fundamentally, our society is more technologically reliant than ever before and there is no sign that this trend will slow. Data leaks that could result in identity theft are now publicly posted on social media accounts. Sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information and bank account details are now stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

The fact of the matter is whether you are an individual, small business, or large multinational, you rely on computer systems every day. Pair this with the rise in cloud services, poor cloud service security, smartphones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) and we have a myriad of potential security vulnerabilities that didn't exist a few decades ago. We need to understand the difference between cybersecurity and information security, even though the skillsets are becoming more similar.

### Examples of Damages to Companies Affected by Cyber Attacks and Data Breaches
The amount of cyber attacks and data breaches in recent years is staggering and it's easy to produce a laundry list of companies that are household names that have been affected.

Here are just a few examples.

‍The Equifax cybercrime identity theft event affected approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers along with 400,000-44 million British residents and 19,000 Canadian residents. Equifax shares dropped 13% in early trading the day after the breach and numerous lawsuits were filed against Equifax as a result of the breach. Not to mention the reputational damage that Equifax suffered. On July 22, 2019, Equifax agreed to a settlement with the FTC which included a $300 million fund for victim compensation, $175m for states and territories in the agreement, and $100 million in fines.

eBay - Between February and March 2014, eBay was the victim of a breach of encrypted passwords, which resulted in asking all of its 145 million users to reset their passwords. Attackers used a small set of employee credentials to access this trove of user data. The stolen information included encrypted passwords and other personal information, including names, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. The breach was disclosed in May 2014, after a month-long investigation by eBay.

Adult Friend Finder - In October 2016, hackers collected 20 years of data on six databases that included names, email addresses, and passwords for The FriendFinder Network. The FriendFinder Network includes websites like Adult Friend Finder, Penthouse.com, Cams.com, iCams.com, and Stripshow.com. Most of the passwords were protected only by the weak SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which meant that 99% of them had been cracked by the time LeakedSource.com published its analysis of the entire data set on November 14.

‍Yahoo disclosed that a breach in August 2013 by a group of hackers had compromised 1 billion accounts. In this instance, security questions and answers were also compromised, increasing the risk of identity theft. The breach was first reported by Yahoo on December 14, 2016, and forced all affected users to change passwords and to reenter any unencrypted security questions and answers to make them encrypted in the future. However, by October of 2017, Yahoo changed the estimate to 3 billion user accounts. An investigation revealed that users' passwords in clear text, payment card data, and bank information were not stolen. Nonetheless, this remains one of the largest data breaches of this type in history.

While these are a few examples of high-profile data breaches, it's important to remember that there are even more that never made it to the front page.

### Personal reflection on Cyber Security
The concept of cybersecurity before I started this course to me was simply the process of securing an organization's computer systems (e.g setting up anti-viruses and passwords). As the course proceeded I began to realize that it is a more complex concept than simply securing an organisations computer systems. It involves every individual in and around an organisation and it is not only the IT department's responsibilities. In actual fact, the IT department should not take any major responsibilities for a cyber-threat/attack as middle and senior management need to make sure that the cybersecurity in an around the organisation is of adequate quality. So far I have learned how cybersecurity has evolved from being little or no concern to organisations to being top 5 of most companies' priorities. The more technology evolves the high the risks of cyberthreats. An interesting point about security, it does not mean that there is a lack of risk or threats, therefore even though an organisation could be highly secured it is still at risk of cyberthreats and attacks. With secure information systems of an organisation there needs to be risk management for when potential threats take place. Cybersecurity policies and frameworks make a great effort of creating a comprehensive standard and procedure that an organisation can follow in order to keep the organisation ready for any present and future threats.

How do I practice cybersecurity in a personal context?

Before studying this module I use to think that I do not practice any sorts of cybersecurity, but as I gained knowledge on what cybersecurity entails I understood the fact that most individuals practice some sort of security in their personal lives or careers on a daily basis. By going to an ATM and entering a pin, accessing your phone or laptop and or purchasing items on an online store, that in itself is a practice of cybersecurity. Individuals practice the process of Identification, authentication, and authorisation on a daily basis without even knowing it. Most companies that we work for use access controls such as Administrative controls (e.g blocking employees from being able to access websites such as twitter, facebook etc), Technological controls (e.g using password encryptions to access files or information) and physical controls ( e.g security guards and access cards). This has made me realize that I engage in cybersecurity on a daily basis much more than I used to think I do.

How secure are my personal data and devices?

My personal data and devices could use a bit more security than they currently have right now. Devices such as my phone and laptop make use of the two-factor verification process of authentication. The data could be more secure as this level of security is not complex and is at risk of cyber threats.

After going through this course, do I think there are steps I need to take in order to make your personal data more secure? What are these steps?

After going through this course I have realized that there are multiple steps i can take to make my personal data more secure. These steps include.
- Looking for confidential and sensitive information and deciding whether or not it is important to keep them on my devices (e.g Identity documents, banking details etc)
- Cleaning out sensitive or important emails that I do not need anymore
- encrypting drives so that sensitive information can be more secure
- Keeping my devices security software up to date
- making sure that the information I give out is to a trustworthy and reputable source.

## IOT Reflection

The potential for innovation and growth that IoT brings to any sector and, in particular, to smart cities is undeniable. We are experiencing the transition into a new era connecting the physical world to the digital world. our vision of an intelligent world, with sensor filled cities, allows us to imagine more ef cient, habitable, safe and resilient towns thanks to the new digital era.

In terms of benefits, smart city technology is helping to improve citizen security, increase the efficiency and management of public infrastructure and promote transparency in government decisions, among many other advantages.

There are many real examples in many cities around the world that are developing projects with technology for different purposes such as monitoring pollution, identifying free parking spaces or controlling the environmental quality of roads, to name just a few examples. In all of these cases, technology is helping to promote transparency in government decision making and thereby enhance democracy.

If a public official can collect real data on the city’s pollution rates that support his decision to restrict traffic, he will be able to better communicate to citizens the reasons behind this action. In this way, citizens will be able to evaluate the merits of the decisions taken about their lives and their communities based on supporting data, rather than mere opinion.

Up until now, the way we have judged our politicians is highly conditioned by their statements or those of their opponents. However, in an interconnected world, where citizens have open and contrasting information about their city, this judgement can be more objective. Furthermore, citizens will benefit from the improvement in their quality of life thanks to applications that develop mobility within cities, such as intelligent parking systems. Other benefits will result from technologies that improve safety by detecting the environmental quality of roads and highways, or that guarantee the quality of the air they breathe, or indeed the water they drink.

On the other hand, we need to temper this very positive view of the benefits of IoT with due consideration of the risks to the individual and society associated with the ever increasing use of digital technology. For example, the apocalyptic vision brought about by the Wannacry virus attack shook many people’s views of the technology. The virus not only affected more than 200,000 computers around the world but companies worldwide had to stop their business activity: among those affected, FedEx interrupted the delivery of goods in the USA, European energy companies collapsed and the machines selling train tickets in Germany stopped working.

We must recognize that security is becoming an inherent risk of IoT. The reality is that as the number of Internet-connected devices increases, the risk also raises exponentially. The forecast is that by 2020 we will have 6 objects per person connected to the Internet, which means 50 billion devices in total.

But the risk associated with having so many devices connected to the Internet and the potential for compromising them is not the only issue. The risks to personal identity and security of personal data are also of great concern, as evidenced by the NSA scandal when personal information was stolen and thousands of users were spied on. As a result, German Prime Minister, Angela Merkel, swapped her iPhone for a Blackberry to protect her privacy. She is the only person I know of who decided to do this. But the question is, do you need to be the German chancellor to worry about your privacy and security?

If we are honest, we currently consider privacy to be a secondary issue if we can get something in return. In fact, there are insurance companies that are offering premium policies if you allow them to install a device in your vehicle that measures the risk level of your driving style. But, at the same time, by signing the contract, you’re selling the information about where and when you go everyday.

The same applies to smart TVs. Everyone has one at home but no one reads the 40 page privacy policy that is included in the user guide. And we should read this, because there are warnings such as “do not say anything confidential in front of your TV, you could be recorded”. In the end, however, for many people convenience trumps privacy. When we speak about the importance of protecting privacy, we need to be honest with ourselves because by our actions and choices we are relegating it to secondary importance.

Complicating matters further, we all have our own opinion about the risks associated with the security of our electronic devices, the privacy of our personal information, the information we are exposed to, or the impact of robots on employment. In many cases these opinions may be in stark conflict with each other.

For example, in a survey conducted by a brand of self-piloting vehicles to potential customers, the majority said they preferred safety systems that prioritized pedestrians; but those same people also said they were not interested in buying that car if it was programmed with that algorithm.

In other words, we have a dual view of technology because of the speed with which the technology is changing, as are its uses and applications. Many of us are struggling to adapt and to balance the risks and opportunities presented by new applications of technology. Thus, if a country restricts the use of drones, it will be preventing terrorist attacks but also restricting the potential use of these devices for sending humanitarian aid.

In summary, digital technology is a tool that has brought about enormous benefits to mankind, including by stimulating economic growth, creating jobs, increasing demand, improving production processes and stimulating the creation of new business models.

The alternative, for anyone who believes the risks of the digital revolution outweigh its opportunities, is to retreat from the modern world – without risks, without worries, but of course, also without access to the Internet and its benefits.

If, on the other hand, we embrace IoT and focus our energies on how to manage the risks involved in its application, we will undoubtedly ensure that the legacy we leave from this digital revolution will be one of great progress and well- being for everyone.
