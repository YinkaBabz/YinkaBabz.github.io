## Cyber Security

### What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the state or process of protecting and recovering computer systems, networks, devices, and programs from any type of cyber attack. Cyber attacks are an increasingly sophisticated and evolving danger to your sensitive data, as attackers employ new methods powered by social engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) to circumvent traditional data security controls.

The fact of the matter is the world is increasingly reliant on technology and this reliance will continue as we introduce the next generation of new technology that will have access to our connected devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

To keep customer data protected while embracing new technology, intelligent cloud security solutions should be implemented alongside strong password policies like multi-factor authentication to mitigate unauthorized access.

### The Importance of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity's importance is on the rise. Fundamentally, our society is more technologically reliant than ever before and there is no sign that this trend will slow. Data leaks that could result in identity theft are now publicly posted on social media accounts. Sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information and bank account details are now stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

The fact of the matter is whether you are an individual, small business, or large multinational, you rely on computer systems every day. Pair this with the rise in cloud services, poor cloud service security, smartphones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) and we have a myriad of potential security vulnerabilities that didn't exist a few decades ago. We need to understand the difference between cybersecurity and information security, even though the skillsets are becoming more similar.

### Examples of Damages to Companies Affected by Cyber Attacks and Data Breaches
The amount of cyber attacks and data breaches in recent years is staggering and it's easy to produce a laundry list of companies that are household names that have been affected.

Here are just a few examples.

Equifax
‍The Equifax cybercrime identity theft event affected approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers along with 400,000-44 million British residents and 19,000 Canadian residents. Equifax shares dropped 13% in early trading the day after the breach and numerous lawsuits were filed against Equifax as a result of the breach. Not to mention the reputational damage that Equifax suffered. On July 22, 2019, Equifax agreed to a settlement with the FTC which included a $300 million fund for victim compensation, $175m for states and territories in the agreement, and $100 million in fines.

eBay
‍Between February and March 2014, eBay was the victim of a breach of encrypted passwords, which resulted in asking all of its 145 million users to reset their passwords. Attackers used a small set of employee credentials to access this trove of user data. The stolen information included encrypted passwords and other personal information, including names, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. The breach was disclosed in May 2014, after a month-long investigation by eBay.

Adult Friend Finder
‍In October 2016, hackers collected 20 years of data on six databases that included names, email addresses, and passwords for The FriendFinder Network. The FriendFinder Network includes websites like Adult Friend Finder, Penthouse.com, Cams.com, iCams.com, and Stripshow.com. Most of the passwords were protected only by the weak SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which meant that 99% of them had been cracked by the time LeakedSource.com published its analysis of the entire data set on November 14.

Yahoo
‍Yahoo disclosed that a breach in August 2013 by a group of hackers had compromised 1 billion accounts. In this instance, security questions and answers were also compromised, increasing the risk of identity theft. The breach was first reported by Yahoo on December 14, 2016, and forced all affected users to change passwords and to reenter any unencrypted security questions and answers to make them encrypted in the future. However, by October of 2017, Yahoo changed the estimate to 3 billion user accounts. An investigation revealed that users' passwords in clear text, payment card data, and bank information were not stolen. Nonetheless, this remains one of the largest data breaches of this type in history.

While these are a few examples of high-profile data breaches, it's important to remember that there are even more that never made it to the front page.

### Personal reflection on Cyber Security
The concept of cybersecurity before I started this course to me was simply the process of securing an organization's computer systems (e.g setting up anti-viruses and passwords). As the course proceeded I began to realize that it is a more complex concept than simply securing an organisations computer systems. It involves every individual in and around an organisation and it is not only the IT department's responsibilities. In actual fact, the IT department should not take any major responsibilities for a cyber-threat/attack as middle and senior management need to make sure that the cybersecurity in an around the organisation is of adequate quality. So far I have learned how cybersecurity has evolved from being little or no concern to organisations to being top 5 of most companies' priorities. The more technology evolves the high the risks of cyberthreats. An interesting point about security, it does not mean that there is a lack of risk or threats, therefore even though an organisation could be highly secured it is still at risk of cyberthreats and attacks. With secure information systems of an organisation there needs to be risk management for when potential threats take place. Cybersecurity policies and frameworks make a great effort of creating a comprehensive standard and procedure that an organisation can follow in order to keep the organisation ready for any present and future threats.

How do I practice cybersecurity in a personal context?

Before studying this module I use to think that I do not practice any sorts of cybersecurity, but as I gained knowledge on what cybersecurity entails I understood the fact that most individuals practice some sort of security in their personal lives or careers on a daily basis. By going to an ATM and entering a pin, accessing your phone or laptop and or purchasing items on an online store, that in itself is a practice of cybersecurity. Individuals practice the process of Identification, authentication, and authorisation on a daily basis without even knowing it. Most companies that we work for use access controls such as Administrative controls (e.g blocking employees from being able to access websites such as twitter, facebook etc), Technological controls (e.g using password encryptions to access files or information) and physical controls ( e.g security guards and access cards). This has made me realize that I engage in cybersecurity on a daily basis much more than I used to think I do.

How secure are my personal data and devices?

My personal data and devices could use a bit more security than they currently have right now. Devices such as my phone and laptop make use of the two-factor verification process of authentication. The data could be more secure as this level of security is not complex and is at risk of cyber threats.

After going through this course, do I think there are steps I need to take in order to make your personal data more secure? What are these steps?

After going through this course I have realized that there are multiple steps i can take to make my personal data more secure. These steps include.
•	Looking for confidential and sensitive information and deciding whether or not it is important to keep them on my devices (e.g Identity documents, banking details etc)
•	Cleaning out sensitive or important emails that I do not need anymore
•	encrypting drives so that sensitive information can be more secure
•	Keeping my devices security software up to date
•	making sure that the information I give out is to a trustworthy and reputable source.
