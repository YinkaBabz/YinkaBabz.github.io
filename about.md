## Welcome to my E-portfolio

### Hi, my name is Olayinka and I'm a student of the Information Department at EMU.
### This is my e-portfolio for ITEC442 Cyber Security and IOT, I have perfomed some scanning activites relating to cyber security and recorded the results and also added my thoughts and opinions about the work I have done. Also I will talk about IOT(Internet Of Things), its importance and relevance to society. And finally you will find my full reflective piece detailing what I understand and I've learnt from ITEC442.
